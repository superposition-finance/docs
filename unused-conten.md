Principal tokens trading at a market discount function like zero-coupon bonds and unlock a whole new asset class in DeFi. Many investors will gravitate towards fixed yield instruments, creating demand for principal tokens while their sellers gain access to most of their principal. These become naturally appreciating assets that provide exposure to stable interest, as an alternative to collateralized lending markets which can require constant movement of funds. If you are long the underlying base asset, it’s also an effective way to acquire them at a discounted price to market, further boosting your expected returns. 

Liquid Interest Tokens give you a lot of flexibility as well. You can sell your principal tokens and hold onto your interest tokens, or you can sell your interest tokens and hold onto your principal tokens, accessing some of tomorrow’s yield today. Or you can sell both! New markets and compounding strategies are bound to emerge \(for example, you can re-stake your principal to gain leveraged exposure to yield\). 

We foresee a future where a significant portion of global lending runs on Solana - and \[placeholder\] is our contribution to building this vision.
