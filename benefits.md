# Benefits

By allowing investors to tokenize and monetize principal and yield separately, Superposition unlocks an entirely novel section of DeFi design space.

### ü§ë Get future yield, today

As anyone who has provided liquidity in DeFi knows, APYs can change dramatically over time, often with little warning. Solana users can now rely on Superposition to transform their unrealized yield into yield tokens, which can be sold on the market to lock-in current APY for upfront cash

### üí∞ More bang for the (crypto) buck

Principal tokens can be thought of as the crypto-equivalent of TradFi‚Äôs zero-coupon bonds. They are discounted versions of an underlying LP token (e.g. a_ Raydium or Saber LP_) that can be bought at a discount, due to time-value of money, and then redeemed for full value at maturity

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gear up with risk-free leverage

Yield tokens allow traders to gain exposure to an asset‚Äôs yield streams without owning the underlying asset itself. Instead of leveraging, speculators can compound Yield Token exposure to multiply returns without borrowing any assets **(which means there is no liquidation risk)**

### üí∏ Unlock a new source of yield

Existing holders of LP tokens can access a new source of yield by routing their activities through Superposition. After minting the relevant Principal and Yield Tokens, these can be deposited into the Superposition AMM to provide liquidity and earn additional APY
