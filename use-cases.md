# Use Cases

## Principal Buyer

* Daniel wishes to purchase SOL because he’s bullish on the Solana ecosystem
* Instead than buying SOL on the spot market for full price, he can purchase a SOL _**Principal Token**_ at a discount to market value
  * _**Principal tokens**_ trade at a discount because they are locked until maturity (e.g. 60 days)
  * At maturity, the _**Principal Tokens**_ can be trustlessly redeemed for the underlying SOL tokens
* Because Daniel is a long term investor, he doesn’t mind holding onto the _**Principal Tokens**_ for 60 days in exchange for extra yield
* Daniel visits the **Superposition** mSOL pool and purchases $1,000 worth of mSOL _**Principal Tokens**_ for $850
  * mSOL _**Principal Tokens**_ are redeemable for SOL
  * mSOL _**Yield Tokens**_ are redeemable for the staking interest paid over the course of the term
* Through **Superposition**, Daniel is able to lock-in an extra 15% in value on his SOL investment compared to just buying on the spot market

## Yield Buyer A

* Chris is a speculator who thinks that DEX trading volume is going to increase due to regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges
* Higher DEX volume will lead to higher fees, which will accrue to the relevant DEX _**Yield Tokens**_, causing them to appreciate in value
* Chris visits the **Superposition** Raydium SOL-USDC LP pool and purchases _**Yield Tokens**_
  * These tokens accrue fees generated by traders buying and selling assets on the Raydium SOL-USDC pool
* When Chris purchases them, they trade with an implied 6% APY
* Over the course of 3 months, APYs rise to 12% due to higher trading volumes, leading to Raydium LP _**Yield Tokens**_ doubling in value
* At maturity, Chris sells the _**Yield Tokens**_ and locks in a 100% return
* Through **Superposition**, Chris is able to speculate on yield rate movements without having to purchase the underlying assets

## Yield Buyer B

* Hannah is a trader who thinks that interest paid to USD stablecoin lenders will increase over time due to FED quantitative tightening
* She visits the **Superposition **Solend USDC pool and purchases _**Yield Tokens**_
  * These tokens entitle her to the interest paid to USDC lenders on Solend
* Over time, her thesis is right and the value of the _**Yield Tokens**_ increases, netting her a profit
* Through **Superposition**, Hannah is able to speculate on interest rate movements in the crypto-asset lending markets, without having to purchase the underlying assets

## Yield Farmer

* Evan is a yield farmer who wants to maximise his APY
* He does his research and decides to provide liquidity on the Raydium SOL-USDC pool
* He provides SOL and USDC to the Raydium pool, receiving a Raydium LP token in return
* He then visits the **Superposition** app and uses his Raydium LP token to mint a set of Raydium SOL-USDC LP _**Principal and Yield tokens**_
* He proceeds to stake those _**Principal and Yield tokens**_ into the **Superposition **liquidity pools to gain extra APY
* At maturity, he unstakes the _**Principal and Yield tokens**_ and redeems the underlying Raydium SOL-USDC LP
  * He then visits the Raydium pool and redeems his USDC and SOL
* At the end of the process, he not only has generated yield on his Raydium LP, but also on his **Superposition** LP
* Through staking on **Superposition**, Evan is able to unlock an extra source of yield on his Raydium LP investment

## Arbitrage Trader

* Laura is a trader who exploits mispricings across crypto-asset markets
* She arbitrages yield differences originating between **Superposition’s** _**Yield Tokens**_ and the underlying yield-bearing assets across protocols
* For example, when yield rates on the Saber USDT-USDC LP pool drop below the ones implied in **Superposition’s** AMM, she purchases the former, mints _**Principal and Yield Token**_ pairs, and sells them on the **Superposition** AMM to lock-in riskless profit
* In doing so, she turns a profit and contributes to keeping yield rates aligned across the market
