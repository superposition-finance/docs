# Liquidity Provision

Aside from the core programs that make up the **Superposition** protocol, there is the possibility to provide liquidity into the Vault's AMM pools, allowing users to generate additional yield on top of their_** Principal and Yield Tokens**_.

Interaction with the AMM pools can be done through the supporting Vault's page in which you will be able to deposit a set of _**Principal and/or Yield Tokens**_ plus their _**Underlying Asset**_ to obtain a _**Superposition LP Token**_.

Our current AMM model is based on the constant product formula _**x \* y = k**_, mostly_** **_for simplicity's sake, but our team is finishing up work on a more robust solution to solve for the special dynamics that _**Principal and Yield Tokens**_ adhere to:

* _**Principal Tokens**_' value increases through time, which means that providing equally-valued amounts of _**Principal Tokens**_ and its _**Underlying Asset**_ for liquidity at any time prior to maturity would secure a small loss as the value of the _**Principal Token**_ converges to the 1:1 ratio that is guaranteed by the protocol once the vault matures. Given the length of vault terms and currently supported assets, this loss is extremely small and should be offset by the trading fees generated by the pool.
* _**Yield Tokens**_ on the other hand are more affected by the volatility of the projected yield than by the time-value of it's locked-reserves. In this case a constant product formula with a time-variant added to it is the most optimal approach and will be placed into production shortly.
