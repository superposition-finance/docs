# How it works

At **Superposition** our goal has been to simplify principal/yield separation and provide an environment for exchanging these new assets. 

**Superposition **works by taking a _**yield-generating token **_and separating its two economic components (principal and yield) into two separate tradable tokens: _**Principal Tokens **_and_** Yield Tokens**_. In practical terms, this is achieved by locking-up a _**yield-generating token**_, like a _Saber_ or _Raydium LP_, into an escrow program and issuing a protocol-determined number of _**Principal and Yield tokens**_. 

At maturity: _**Principal Tokens**_ can be redeemed 1-for-1 for the value of the _**yield-generating token**_ at time of minting, whereas _**Yield Tokens**_ can be redeemed for the yield generated by the _**yield-generating token **_from the moment of minting until maturity

#### Example

Letâ€™s assume that a DeFi user wishes to provide _$10,000_ worth of liquidity on a _Saber LP USDC-USDT Liquidty Pool_ over the course of _12 months_.

If after generating the _**LP tokens**_ and _right at the start_ of a **Superposition** 12-month vault the user proceeds to deposit the _**LP tokens**_ into the vault he will receive _**10,000**_ _**LP Principal Tokens**_ redeemable for 1_0,000 USDC/USDT_ in _12 months_ and _**10,000 LP Yield Tokens**_ redeemable for the yield generated by the _**LP tokens**_ throughout the _12 months_, if the average rate turned out to be _10%_, the _**10,000 LP Yield Tokens**_ would have a terminal value of _1,000 USDC/USDT_ (or _0.1 USDC/USDT_ per _**Yield Token**_)
