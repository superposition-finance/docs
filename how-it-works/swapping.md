# Swapping

Swapping _**Principal and/or Yield Tokens**_ can be accomplished through the supporting Vault's AMM pools which can be found on the Vault page.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

The protocol currently supports trading _**Principal and Yield Tokens**_ against the _**yield-generating token's**_ underlying asset. 

E.g. A _**Saber USDC-USDT LP Principal Token**_ can be exchanged for _**USDC**_ or _**USDT**_
