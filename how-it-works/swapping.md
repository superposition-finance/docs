# Swapping

Swapping Principal and/or Yield Tokens can be accomplished through the supporting Vault's AMM pools which can be found on the Vault page.

The protocol currently supports trading Principal and Yield Tokens against the yield-generating token's underlying asset. 

E.g. A Saber USDC-USDT LP Principal Token can be exchanged for USDC or USDT
