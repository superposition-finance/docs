# Overview

Yield is how DeFi protocols reward active participants. 

When you stake in most DeFi protocols you get back tokens that are redeemable for your initial deposit plus any yield generated throughout the duration of your stake \(usually called “LP” tokens\), but these come with capital-efficiency problems:

1.  Yield rates are usually market-based and thus variable and often volatile, so you have no certainty about the ultimate value until redemption.
2. Your deposit is locked for the duration of your stake. It’s still yours, but you can’t use it elsewhere for the duration of your deposit.

**Superposition** is a protocol that allows developers and investors to harness the power of yield in their applications and strategies by addressing these two issues as a layer on top of yield-generating protocols.  
It works by separating the principal from the interest of a given stake into two separate, tradable tokens:

* Principal Tokens
* Yield Tokens 

At the end of a set term \(e.g. 3 or 6 months\) your Principal Tokens are redeemable for the value of your principal at time of minting, while your Yield Tokens are redeemable for the yield generated by the principal since the time of minting.

_This value is expressed as a portion of the locked LP Tokens._

Through our supporting AMM Pools, users can trade their Principal and Yield Tokens in the open market, enabling a variety of [use cases](use-cases.md).
